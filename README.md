# Simple 21

## The Game
In this game of 21 the player will play against the computer. The goal of the game is to draw cards whose added value will be as close as possible or equal to 21. At the beginning the player will draw two cards. Upon receiving the two cards the player will look at them and decide to `HIT` or `STAY`. If the player picks `HIT` he will be dealt one more card. The player can `HIT` as many times as they wish. When the user choses to `STAY` the computer will draw three cards from the same deck and the added value of the players cards will be compared. Whoever is closest to 21 wins.

### Value Of Cards
- 2-9 = Face Value e.g. 5 of hearts = 5 points, 8 of diamonds = 8 points
- J,Q,K = 10 points
- A = 1 point or 11 points
